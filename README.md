# Advanced Python for Mindstorms Robot Inventor

This repository contains technical information and open source code for advanced Python programming
of Mindstorms Robot Inventor (51515) LEGO set. Due to shared hardware and software internals, most
information and code presented here should also be applicable to the Spike Prime (45678) set.

We do not intend to cover the Mindstorms EV3 (31313) set. Since Micropython firmware also exists for
that set, some general information and techniques presented here might also be applicable to EV3.
Despite this, there are big architectural differences between EV3 and Robot Inventor, so we
recommend other online resources focusing on EV3 for that set.
